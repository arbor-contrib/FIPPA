# FIPPA: The Functional Interplay between Plasticity Processes on Arbor

The goal of FIPPA is to extend the neural network simulator
[Arbor](https://arbor-sim.github.io) by key plasticity processes that
will allow to simulate and analyze the long-term adaptive dynamics of
large-scale, morphologically-detailed neuronal networks.The models
that will be ported and augmented are based on the neuro-theoretical
framework by [tetzlab.com](https://tetzlab.com). These models already
indicated that the interplay between the plasticity processes of
synaptic plasticity, synaptic scaling, and structural plasticity
yields the formation and organization of motor memories.The research
question is how multi-compartment neuron models with detailed synaptic
dynamics can be utilized to improve the performance of such
networks. Our main hypothesis is that the adaptive dynamics on the
network level enforces the specialization of branches by the formation
of synaptic clusters leading to the formation of self-sustaining
long-term memories and an overall increase in storage capacity.
